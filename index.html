        <h2>FRIENDSHIP</h2>
        <p>We make connections and develop relationships because we are surrounded by family. Friends are, however, made by our instinct. Friendship is a bond that goes beyond societal prejudices and creates a passion that is essential to creating a better world. A devoted relationship between two or more individuals like friendship, irrespective of their differences, kindles immense love and care for each other. Friendship is one of the greatest bonds that one can ever have and wish for.True friendship is formed when one person stands by you and is ready to help you. A true friend understands your feelings and emotions. True friendship is when you feel happy spending quality time with someone, and time seems to stand still. Honesty, loyalty, and equality are the essence of a true friendship.

        <h2>IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDSHIP</h2>
        <p>Friendship is integral and important to our existence. It teaches us great things about life. We learn many life lessons from a friendship that can never be found in any other relationship. Relationships like father-son, mother-daughter, and sister-brother are formed due to blood relations. We love these relationships because we are born into them. But friends have a special place in our lives. Friends help us to understand how to trust and motivate each other. Friends take us through the right path and guard us against evil. Friendship teaches us the value of being loyal and the gratitude that one can get when we are shown loyalty. Friendships make us strong as individuals as we learn to share the joys and sorrows of others. Friendship tests our patience and also our ability to set aside our egos. We learn to change ourselves when we have a difference of opinion with friends but do not want to lose our friendship
